          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Sandile Moremedi. A Web developer and much more than that.
            Based in South Africa, a place where there are multi talented people
            from different background and multiple personalities, so I'm well
            fitted to work with different kinds of people and clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started during the pandemic and honestly speaking, it's
            been challenging because I'm a self-taught developer and that is one
            of the most hardest truth I have ever face and yet I'm proud of the
            circumstance I had.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily with all that I learned the bases of responsibility and how
            to use the resources I have to the fullest. And I feel that that's
            what sets me apart from most CS and IT students out there because
            self-taught programmers teach themselves how to work with what they
            have.
